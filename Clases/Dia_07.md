# The European Spallation Source Data Acquisition

Author: Richard HALL-WILTON

Spallation facilities has one of the biggest Neutrino ray in the world.

Measurement of the cross section and the probability to measure the Neutrino from the beam.

The target is located in the center of the experiment, and the neutrino bean is accelerate to this. Also they mentioned the use of Proton beam.

About the sensor:

**Typical detector requirements**:

- Size from 0.25m^2 up to 30m^2
- Position resoluton 100um - 10mm
- Time resolution <1us
- Rate and DAQ requirements very much defined by the instrument and data topology
- Can be >MHz/channel instantaneous in some cases
- Average rates much lower
- Every instrument is very much a bespoke individual design
- For a good user experience
  - it is important to design the detector to the individual detector
  - It is important to make sure that the DAQ can cope with the and has a homogeneous look and feel.

### Structure of a Detector


### Pipeline

- **Data acquisition**
- **Calculation**: Based on previous experiments, previous observations, model building
- Simulation
- Prototype

It is how a final data processed is looked

## Data Acquisition Chain

The integration of the DAQ for the instruments is done at hte backend readout electronics

How the Readout electronics is configurate?

**VMM3A** is equivalent to the **VFAT**, also can to works with GEMs.

#### Some final thought

- Development time is long, takes around 10 years to have data
- All the proposal project begins in 1950 and is spected that works fully in 2030.
- It is necessary to do collaboration with other institutions to build the different stages of the experiment.
