# Development in X-RAY spectrography

Author: Kalliopi KANAKI (IAEA, Austria)

#### XRD analysis through difractogram

the provide repsponses in different frequency bands and allows to identify the comopsition of a sample.

### Access to accelerator facilities

They have soome facilities to make this kind of analysis

They have Neutron generators

Water bricks works as a shirld for the neutrons, 

The protocol is quick strict, you need to do some simulations to evaluate the quantity of radiation, and to convince the authorities about the security of the study before to make the study.

### Facilities are open for people

The facilities are available for classification of Gammas and neutrons.

They have Muclear Instrumentation in-Situ. it means you have a stationary device to do the measurements but you can to transport this to do analysis in other places.

the drone flys two times

1. Used to make a geometrical reconstruction of the area of analysis.
2. Used to make the Gamma ray spectrometry of this site.

They also work in Neutrino detection.

These are the facilities of the laboratory.
