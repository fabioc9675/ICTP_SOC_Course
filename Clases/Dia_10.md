# Quantum computing on FPGA

In ICTP they are working in the development of a platform call **Qemulator** or Quantum Emulator, in which, they can simulate the architecture of a quantum computer to work with quantum problems.

They have the capability to simulate some Qbits in the hardware to make calculations in quantum computing.

> Some problem that are complicate in classical computing, can be easy in quantum computer, but not all. The idea is to use the tool to solve some specific applications, not for everything.

They are solving problems in **Game Theory** using the FPGA to simulate and run Quantum Algorithms.
